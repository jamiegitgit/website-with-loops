                        <div class="about">
                           <p >The Oakland Mosaic Trash Can Project is a grassroots public art project that has been spreading through Oakland since 2010.</p> 

                           <p>The project was inspired by the mosaics in the town of Arcata, which prompted city employee Roberto Costa to begin tiling the trash bins. He was awarded a grant from Keep Oakland Beautiful and with donations and volunteer support he completed the first mosaic cans, located in the Allendale neighborhood.</p>

                           <p>The next neighborhood to create them was Adams Point, an effort spearheaded by Vivian Romero. She loved the cans in Allendale and was able to organize a group to complete 25 cans, many of which are along the lake.</p>

                           <p>Next Tiffany Eng, an Old Oakland resident, took up the project.  After an initial can commemorating a local victim of gun violence, the Old Oakland cans became a joint project with the Golden Gate Aubudon Society that featured a native bird on each can.</p>

                           <p>Since then the project has continued to grow as more community leaders have spearheaded projects in their own neighborhoods. There is no official record of where these trash cans are and who created them. This site is an attempt to catalog and record any and all information about this stunning art project.</p>
